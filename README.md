# Card-Classifier
Classifies cards from Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, and Yugioh.  

Try it on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BrianZhang/Card-Classifier).

Developed by fine-tuning resnet34 with the fastai library, using 200 images from each card game, scraped autonomously from DuckDuckGo.  
See model training steps in `development_journal.ipynb`.  

Uses principles from Jeremy Howard's course, [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). Thanks Jeremy!
